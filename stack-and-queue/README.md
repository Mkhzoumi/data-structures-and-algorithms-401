# Stacks and Queues
## Challenge
this challenge is about making a stack and a queue classes, and some of their methods like (push , pop , peek , isEmpty) for Stack , and (enqueue, dequeue , peek , isEmpty) for Queue.
## Approach & Efficiency
all of my methods big O notation are equal to O(1), for both time and space complexity, because i didnt use any type of loops or arrays.

## API

### Stack methods:
+ push: adding a new Node to the Stack, insert it as the top of the stack.
+ pop: deleting the top node of the stack and making the next node as the new top.
+ peek: return the value of the top node of the stack.
+ isEmpty: returns true if the stack is empty and false if not.

### queue methods:
+ enqueue: adding a new node to the end of the queue.
+ dequeue: deleting the first node of the queue and assigning the next node as the new first.
+ peek: return the value of the first node in the queue.
+ isEmpty: return true if the queue is empty or false if not.
